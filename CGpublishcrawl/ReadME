to go SLS and crawl data out from featured lessons, in theory it can crawl out all the data but i believe that is a limit like 6000 due to the loop didnt work if i increase the numbertocrawl.
indeed thre is a limit to the tagui loop number no larger than 6000
if need to run large numbers, split the loop into smaller parts


current working
need to key in the numbertocrawl manually as it is not possible to run 6500, so just edit to small number for the month

strengths
even if stops suddenly, the data crawled is saved as it crawls.


output
publish_list.csv

a small sample is include to show how it looks like, with confidential info removed of course
