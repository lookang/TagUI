to go SLS and crawl data out from featured lessons, in theory it can crawl out all the data but i believe that is a limit like 6000 due to the loop didnt work if i increase the numbertocrawl.

current working
need to key in the numbertocrawl manually as it is not possible to pre determine and easy to read the code.

strengths
even if stops suddenly, the data crawled is saved as it crawls.


output
publish_list.csv

a small sample is include to show how it looks like, with confidential info removed of course
