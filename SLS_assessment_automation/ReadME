If you have 1000 of questions to post to SLS, this automation tool could be for you!

Recommended use
download output.csv
edit output.csv to your own questions
add new rows if needed but keep the rows and columns in the same position ( dont delete or add new columns, only add new rows)
save the file output.csv

run TagUI file by typing in command prompt
tagui /Users/lookang/Desktop/tagui/flows/SLS_assessment_automation/posttosls5.tag
first time prepare the login to SLS and gmail for the otp, means key in your login id and password and the gmail login and password for the OTP, select let Chrome manage the password. So TagUI code will not store the confidential info.
run TagUI again
it should be able to populate the questions now.
Enjoy!
