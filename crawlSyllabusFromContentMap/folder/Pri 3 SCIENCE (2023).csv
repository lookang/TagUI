1,Diversity
2,Diversity of living and non-living things (General characteristics and classification)
3,"Describe the characteristics of living things.

Need water, food and air to survive 
Grow, respond and reproduce"
4,"Recognise some broad groups of living things based on similarities and differences. 

Plants (flowering, non-flowering)
Animals (amphibians, birds, fish, insects, mammals, reptiles)              
Fungi (mould, mushroom, yeast)
Bacteria"
5,Observe a variety of living and non-living things and infer differences between them.
6,Classify living things into broad groups (in plants and animals) based on similarities and differences of common observable characteristics.
7,Show curiosity by questioning and exploring the surrounding living and non-living things.
8,Show care and concern by being responsible towards living things.
9,Diversity of Materials
10,"Relate the use of various types of materials (wood, metal, ceramic, rubber, glass, plastic, fabric) to their physical properties."
11,"Compare physical properties of materials.

Strength
Flexibility
Ability to float/sink in water
Waterproof
Transparency"
12,Show objectivity by using data and information to validate observations and explanations about the properties and uses of materials.
13,Cycles
14,Cycles in plants and animals (Life Cycles)
15,"Show an understanding that different living things have different life cycles.

Plants
Animals"
16,Observe and compare the life cycles of plants grown from seeds over a period of time.
17,"Observe and compare the life cycles of animals over a period of time (chicken, cockroach, frog, grasshopper, beetle, butterfly, mosquito)"
18,Show curiosity by questioning and exploring the surrounding plants and animals.

20,Interactions
21,Interactions of forces (Magnets)
22,Recognise that a magnet can exert a push or a pull.
23,"Identify the characteristics of magnets.

Magnets can be made of iron or steel.
Magnets have two poles. A freely suspended bar magnet comes to rest pointing in a North-South direction.Unlike poles attract and like poles repel.
Magnets attract magnetic materials."
24,Recognise uses of magnets in everyday objects.
25,"Compare magnets, non-magnetic materials and magnetic materials."
26,Make a magnet by the stroke method and the electrical method.
27,Show curiosity in exploring the uses of magnets in everyday life.
