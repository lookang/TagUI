1,Cycles
2,Cycles in matter and water (Matter)
3,State that matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.
4,"Differentiate between the three states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) in terms of shape and volume."
5,Measure mass and volume using appropriate apparatus.
6,Show curiosity in exploring matter in the surroundings and question what they find.
7,Systems
8,Plant System (Plant parts and functions)
9,Identify the different parts of plants and state their functions.- Leaf- Stem- Root
10,Observe plant parts.
11,Show curiosity in exploring the surrounding plants and question what they find.
12,Show care and concern by being responsible towards plants.
13,Human system (Digestive system)
14,"Identify the human systems in the body and state their functions (digestive, respiratory, circulatory, skeletal and muscular)."
15,"Identify the parts in the human digestive system (mouth, gullet, stomach, small intestine and large intestine) and describe their functions."
16,Show curiosity in questioning about the structures or functions of the body.
17,Energy
18,Energy Forms and uses (Light)
19,Recognise that an object can be seen when it reflects light or when it is a source of light.
20,Recognise that light travels in straight lines and thus a shadow is formed when light is completely or partially blocked by an object.
21,"Investigate the variables that affect shadows formed.

Shape, size and position of object(s)
Distance between light source-object and object-screen"
22,Show objectivity by using data and information to validate observations and explanations about light.
23,Energy Forms and uses (Heat)
24,Identify some common sources of heat.
25,State that the temperature of an object is a measurement of its degree of hotness.
26,State that heat is a form of energy.
27,Differentiate between heat and temperature.\u00a0
28,Show an understanding that heat flows from a hotter to a colder object/region/place until both reach the same temperature.
29,Relate the change in temperature of an object to the gain or loss of heat by the object.
30,"List some effects of heat gain/loss in our everyday life.

Contraction / expansion of objects (solid, liquid and gas)
Change in state of matter"
31,"Identify good and poor conductors of heat.

Good conductors: metals
Poor conductors: wood, plastics, air, rubber"
32,Measure temperature using a thermometer and a datalogger with temperature/heat sensors.
33,Show objectivity by seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations about heat.
34,Enrichment
