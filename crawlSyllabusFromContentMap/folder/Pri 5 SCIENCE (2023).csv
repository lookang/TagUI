1,Cycles
2,Cycles in Plants and Animals (Reproduction)
3,Recognise that a cell is a basic unit of life.
4,Show an understanding that living things reproduce to ensure continuity of their kind and that many characteristics of an organism are passed on from parents to offspring.
5,"Describe processes in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants.

Pollination
Fertilisation (seed production)
Seed dispersal
Germination"
6,Recognise the process of fertilisation in the sexual reproduction of humans.
7,Recognise the similarity in terms of fertilisation in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants and humans.
8,"Investigate the ways in which plants reproduce.

Spores
Seeds"
9,Show curiosity by questioning and exploring the surrounding plants and animals.
10,Show care and concern by being responsible towards plants and animals.
11,Cycles in Matter and Water (Water)
12,Recognise that water can exist in three interchangeable states of matter.
13,"Show an understanding of how water changes from one state to another.

Melting (solid to liquid)
Freezing (liquid to solid)
Boiling/Evaporation (liquid to gas)
Condensation (gas to liquid)"
14,Show an understanding of the terms melting point of ice (or freezing point of water) and boiling point of water.
15,Show an understanding of the roles of evaporation and condensation in the water cycle.
16,Recognise the importance of the water cycle.
17,Recognise the importance of water to life processes.
18,Describe the impact of water pollution on Earth's water resources.
19,Compare water in 3 states.
20,"Investigate the effect of heat gain or loss on the temperature and state of water.

When ice is heated, it melts and changes to water at 0
When water is cooled, it freezes and changes to ice at 0
When water is heated, it boils and changes to steam at 100
When steam is cooled, it condenses to water."
21,"Investigate the factors which affect the rate of evaporation.

Wind
Temperature
Exposed surface area"
22,Show concern for water as a limited natural resource and be responsible in conserving.
23,Systems
24,Plant System (Respiratory and circulatory systems)
25,Identify the parts of the plant transport system and describe their functions.
26,Investigate how food and water are transported in the plant.
27,Show objectivity by seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations about plant parts and functions.
28,Show care and concern by being responsible towards plants.
29,Human System (Respiratory and circulatory systems)
30,"Recognise that air is a mixture of gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapour."
31,"Identify the parts of the human respiratory (nose, windpipe, lungs) and circulatory systems (heart, blood, blood vessels) and describe their functions."
32,"Recognise the integration of the different systems (digestive, respiratory and circulatory) in carrying out life processes."
33,"Compare how plants, fish and humans take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide."
34,"Compare the ways in which substances are transported within plants and humans.

Plants: Tubes that transport food and water
Humans: Blood vessels that transport digested food, oxygen and carbon dioxide"
35,Show objectivity by seeking data and information to validate observations and explanations about the human body.
36,Electrical System
37,"Recognise that an electric circuit consisting of an energy source (battery) and other circuit components (wire, bulb, switch) forms an electrical system."
38,Show an understanding that a closed circuit allows current to flow.
39,Identify electrical conductors and insulators.
40,Construct simple circuits from circuit diagrams.
41,"Investigate the effect of some variables on the current in a circuit.

Number of batteries (arranged in series)
Number of bulbs (arranged in series and parallel)"
42,Show concern for the need to conserve and to have proper use and handling of electricity.
43,Enrichment
