1,Interactions
2,"Interaction of forces (Frictional force, gravitational force)"
3,Identify a force as a push or a pull.
4,"State the effects of a force.

A force can move a stationary object.
A force can speed up, slow down or change the direction of motion.
A force can stop a moving object.

A force may change the shape of an object."
5,"Recognise and give examples of the different types of forces.

Magnetic force
Gravitational force
Frictional force"
6,Recognise that objects have weight because of the gravitational force acting on the object.\u00a0
7,Investigate the effect of frictional force on the motion of objects.
8,Show objectivity by using data and information to validate observations and explanations about forces.
9,Interaction within the environment
10,"Identify the factors that affect the survival of an organism.

Physical characteristics of the environment (temperature, light, water)
Availability of food
Types of other organisms

present (producers, consumers, decomposers)"
11,"Recognise the energy pathway from the Sun through living things and identify the roles of various organisms (producers, consumers, predators, prey) in a food chain."
12,"Recognise that different habitats support different organisms (garden, field, pond, seashore, tree, mangrove swamp)."
13,"Recognise that adaptations serve to enhance survival and can be structural or behavioural.

Cope with physical factors
Obtain food
Escape predators
Reproduce by finding and attracting mates or dispersing seeds/fruits"
14,Give examples of man\u2019s impact (both positive and negative) on the environment.
15,"Observe, collect, and record information regarding the interacting factors within an environment."
16,Show care and concern for Man\u2019s impact on the environment by being respectful and responsible towards the environment.
17,Energy
18,Energy forms and uses (Photosynthesis)
19,Recognise that the Sun is our primary source of energy (light and heat).
20,"Investigate the requirements (water, light energy and carbon dioxide) for photosynthesis (production of sugar and oxygen)."
21,Show objectivity by using data and information to validate observations and explanations about photosynthesis.
22,Enrichment
