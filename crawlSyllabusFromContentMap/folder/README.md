These are just csv of the content map learning objectives that are same as from the SEAB or MOE website which is already on the public internet.

For example
https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/primary/mathematics_syllabus_primary_1_to_6.pdf
pages 33 onwards for Primary 1 Math content map learning objectives

it is the same as Pri 1 Mathematics (2021).csv
