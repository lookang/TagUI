Dear CG Admin, 
<br><br>
Happy Greetings üëã and SLS is in release 14! Our apologies if you receive duplicate requests, We will be sending out for all pending lessons (old and new requests).
We hope to clear as many CG lessons in the pending review tab (there are only 47 lessons) and it also took some time to fix (new interface and new xPath code) the TagUI robotic process automation.  üôè Thank you!

The following lesson(s) is/are pending your review.
Please login to SLS https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login to review before {}. <br><br>
